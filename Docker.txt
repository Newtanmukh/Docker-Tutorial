sudo systemctl status docker : will give u the status of the docker.
			       you can check the Active : thing to see whether it is active or inactive

sudo systemctl enable --now docker : start and enable the docker.

				if it doesnt start, then reboot your OS.

sudo docker run hello-world : 

sudo docker images : will list you the number of images we have here.

sudo docker version. : docker client and docker server. docker is running in a virutal machine,which is linux.

sudo docker run hello-world : will pull this image from internet.


why should we use docker?
1) get required software
2) cannot install on this machine/requires python 3.8
3) troubleshoot. re run installer. then, we get another error. again we go to 2), and we find out that we need another framework again. this keeps going on.

docker says that, contarize it.
there will be a container which will have its own resources and software.that will run the software. dockerize/containerize.
guaranteed to run. isolated environment having its own resources/software.


docker client is the command line(CLI). it will ask the docker output for the commands etc.
docker server can communicate directly with the client. docker daemon is a service that runs on your host operating ssystem. it is responsible for running containers.

Image : image is like a seed and a file. it has all the information and data inside to make a tree. no resources has been assigned till now.
container : is like a full grown tree. it is what is produced from the image.

some part of the hard disk for the container. all this details will be inside the image. 
docker run hello-world : this command will be given to client. the client will then ask the same from the server.
if image not in the cache, then will download it from the internet.

DOCKER HUB is the place from where we download the images. infact we can also upload our images there.

if first time download, then keep the images inside the cache, since we might ask for it again.

What is container ? 
we have apps like chrome,notepad etc.



sudo docker ps : will show the list of all the images running
