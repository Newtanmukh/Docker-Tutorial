Open source container orchestration tool. Originally developed by google.
Kubernets helps you manage containerized applications in different environments, physical virtual as well as cloud.

high avaibility of no downtime(always accisable by user),scalibility of high performance,disaster ecovery(data is so).



Kubernets architecture,
one master node, many worker nodes. each worker node has qublet running on it.
each qublet is a process that allows the cluster to talk/comminucate to each other, and execute some tasks on the nodes.
each worker node has docker containers of different applications running on it.
depending on the distribution, you will have different number of docker applications running on each different worker node.


Master node runs the various kubernets processes that ae necessary to run and manage cluster properly.
one of such is API server, which is entrypoint to kubernets cluster.

UI,API and CLI talks to the master node.

virtual network controls everything here. they manage the way the master and worker nodes talk to each other. one powerful machine 
they have the most nodes.


we may have two masters, so as to ensure that cluster continues to master.
